Exercises

In these exercises, you will modify project contents and delete a project. You have already learned how to perform the Create and Read part of CRUD operations. This will complete your CRUD experience by adding Update and Delete.

You should try to follow the instructions as best you can. Suggestions for variable and method names are given – you can take those suggestions or not as you wish. If you deviate from the instructions, try to stick to Java best practices by naming methods and variables for what they do or what they are. If you get stuck, see the Solutions section at the end of this document.




  Update project details

In this section, you will update a project row. There is a lot remaining to be done for an industrious student: adding materials, steps, and categories, maintaining categories; modifying materials and steps; changing step order, etc. In this section, you will gain part of that skill set.

Follow these steps to update the project details.




  Changes to the menu application


In this section, you will make changes to the menu application to allow the user to update project details. You will add a new menu selection and add a method call in the switch statement. Finally, you will create a method to get project detail changes from the user and call the project service to make the modifications.

In this section, you will be working in ProjectsApp.java.

1.       Add the line "4) Update project details" to the list of operations.

2.       Add case 4 to the switch statement and call method updateProjectDetails(). Let Eclipse create the method for you.

3.       In method updateProjectDetails():

a.       Check to see if curProject is null. If so, print a message "\nPlease select a project." and return from the method.

b.       For each field in the Project object, print a message along with the current setting in curProject. Here is an example:







c.       Create a new Project object. If the user input for a value is not null, add the value to the Project object. If the value is null, add the value from curProject. Repeat for all Project variables.






d.       Set the project ID field in the Project object to the value in the curProject object.

e.       Call projectService.modifyProjectDetails(). Pass the Project object as a parameter. Let Eclipse create the method for you in ProjectService.java.

f.        Reread the current project to pick up the changes by calling projectService.fetchProjectById(). Pass the project ID obtained from curProject.







g.       Save all files. At this point you should have no compilation errors.




   Changes to the project service

In this section you will make changes to the project service. The service is responsible for calling the DAO to update the project details and to return those details to the caller. If the project cannot be found, the service throws an exception. The service method is called by the menu application class, and results are returned to that class.

In this section you will be working in ProjectService.java.

1.       In the method modifyProjectDetails(),

a.       Call projectDao.modifyProjectDetails(). Pass the Project object as a parameter. The DAO method returns a boolean that indicates whether the UPDATE operation was successful. Check the return value. If it is false, throw a DbException with a message that says the project does not exist.





b.       Let Eclipse create the modifyProjectDetails() method for you in ProjectDao.java. Save all files. At this point you should have no compilation errors.




   Changes to the project DAO

Now, complete the code in the project DAO to update the project details. The method structure is similar to the insertProject() method. You will write the SQL UPDATE statement with the parameter placeholders. Then, obtain a Connection and start a transaction. Next, you will obtain a PreparedStatement object and set the six parameter values. Finally, you will call executeUpdate() on the PreparedStatement and commit the transaction.

The difference in this method and the insert method is that you will examine the return value from executeUpdate(). The executeUpdate() method returns the number of rows affected by the UPDATE operation. Since a single row is being acted on (comparing to the primary key in the WHERE clause guarantees this), the return value should be 1. If it is 0 it means that no rows were acted on and the primary key value (project ID) is not found. So, the method returns true if executeUpdate() returns 1 and false if it returns 0.

In this section you will be working in ProjectDao.java.

1.       In modifyProjectDetails(), write the SQL statement to modify the project details. Do not update the project ID – it should be part of the WHERE clause. Remember to use question marks as parameter placeholders.







2.       Obtain the Connection and PreparedStatement using the appropriate try-with-resource and catch blocks. Start and rollback a transaction as usual. Throw a DbException from each catch block.

3.       Set all parameters on the PreparedStatement. Call executeUpdate() and check if the return value is 1. Save the result in a variable.

4.       Commit the transaction and return the result from executeUpdate() as a boolean. At this point there should be no compilation errors.




   Test it


1.       First, test the application by updating project details without selecting a project. You should receive an error message. Include in your video a shot of the console showing the selections and error message. 

2.       Next, select a project. Then, select "Update project details". Enter new project details and update the project.  Include in your video a shot of the console showing the selected project details, the data you input, and the new project details.   It should look something like this:

  Delete a project

In this section, you will write the code to delete a project. This will require a little preparation. You must verify that ON DELETE CASCADE in the CREATE TABLE statements works to remove child rows (materials, steps, and project_category rows). This means that you will need to make sure the project has child records. Since the application does not currently add the child rows, you will need to add them using a MySQL client like DBeaver or the MySQL CLI.

Hint: you may want to test this a couple of times. If you add some insert statements at the end of projects-schema.sql, you can simply load and execute the SQL statements as many times as you want. In the following example, not all CREATE TABLE statements are shown.





Here are the steps for DBeaver:

1.       Right-click on the connection name. Select "SQL Editor" / "Recent SQL script". The editor should open and it should have the name <projects> in the top tab (assuming the connection is named "projects").






2.       Paste the entire contents of projects-schema.sql into the DBeaver editor. Select all the text in the editor. Right-click in the editor. Select "Execute" / "Execute SQL Script"








   Changes to the menu application

In this section you will add code to display a new menu operation to the user ("Delete a project"). Then you will add the case statement to the switch. Next, you will write the method that will list the projects to delete, get the project ID from the user, and call the service to delete the project.

In this section you will be working in ProjectsApp.java.

1.       Add a new option: "5) Delete a project" to the list of operations.

2.       Add case 5 to the switch statement. Call the method deleteProject(). Let Eclipse create the method for you.

3.       In method deleteProject():

a.       Call method listProjects().

b.       Ask the user to enter the ID of the project to delete.

c.       Call projectService.deleteProject() and pass the project ID entered by the user.

d.       Print a message stating that the project was deleted. (If it wasn't deleted, an exception is thrown by the service class.)

e.       Add a check to see if the project ID in the current project is the same as the ID entered by the user. If so, set the value of curProject to null.

f.        Have Eclipse create the deleteProject() method in the project service.

g.       Save all files. At this point there should be no compilation errors.




   Changes to the project service

The deleteProject() method in the service is very similar to the modifyProjectDetails() method. You will call the deleteProject() method in the DAO class and check the boolean return value. If the return value is false, a DbException is thrown with a message that the project with the given ID does not exist. The exception will be picked up by the exception handler in the application menu class.

In this section you will be working in ProjectService.java.

1.       Call deleteProject() in the project DAO. Pass the project ID as a parameter. The method returns a boolean. Test the return value from the method call. If it returns false, throw a DbException with a message stating that the project doesn't exist.

2.       Have Eclipse create the deleteProject() method in the ProjectDao class.

3.       Save all files. At this point there should be no compilation errors.




   Changes to the project DAO

The deleteProject() method in the DAO is very similar to the modifyProjectDetails() method. You will first create the SQL DELETE statement. Then, you will obtain the Connection and PreparedStatement, and set the project ID parameter on the PreparedStatement. Then, you will call executeUpdate() and verify that the return value is 1, indicating a successful deletion. Finally, you will commit the transaction and return success or failure.

In this section you will be working in ProjectDao.java.

1.       In the method deleteProject():

a.       Write the SQL DELETE statement. Remember to use the placeholder for the project ID in the WHERE clause.

b.       Obtain a Connection and a PreparedStatement. Start, commit, and rollback a transaction in the appropriate sections.

c.       Set the project ID parameter on the PreparedStatement.

d.       Return true from the menu if executeUpdate() returns 1.




   Test it

In this section, you will perform two tests. The first test will delete a project with an unknown project ID and the second test will actually perform the deletion.

  Delete with invalid ID

This tests the delete operation with an invalid project ID.

1.       Run the application.

2.       Select "Delete a project". When you are prompted to enter a project ID to delete, enter an invalid ID.

3.       Include a shot of the console showing that an error was generated, and that the application handled it gracefully.   Here is a sample:

  Delete a project


In this section you will test that you can do an actual deletion.

1.       Run the application.

2.       Select "Delete a project". When you are prompted to enter a project ID to delete, enter a valid ID.

3.       List the projects to show that the project was deleted with no errors.

4.       Include a shot of the console.   Here is a sample:






5.       Verify that materials, steps, and project_category rows were deleted as well. Use DBeaver or the MySQL CLI for this. The child rows should have been deleted due to the ON DELETE CASCADE in the foreign key statements.
